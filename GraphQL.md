# GraphQL Interview Questions

## Beginner

### 001 What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is both a query language and a server-side runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exact data they need.

### 002 What is difference between a mutation and a query in GraphQL?

Mutations are used to write or change data, while Queries are used to read data.

### 003 What is a GraphQL schema?

A GraphQL schema describes the capabilities of a GraphQL server by defining a list of types and directives. It describes:

1. types of data that can be queried and manipulated
2. the relationships between these types
3. queries and mutations that are available

The schema acts as a contract that specifies what information the client may request and how the server will respond.

### 004 What are scalar types in GraphQL?

Scalar types are basic atomic data types in GraphQL that represent single values. They include:

1. String for text
2. Int for integers
3. Float for floating-point numbers
4. Boolean for true or false values
5. ID for unique identifiers

Scalars are used to represent the leaves of the GraphQL query tree, serving as the foundation for more complex data structures.
